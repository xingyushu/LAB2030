# LAB of computing III
A reference for computing III lab

### Need to know 

* THe computing III labs are done by a group of four.You can checkout the members and discuss together.
* One submission by the "presenter" from each group made via blackboard. You can refer the  presenter in code comments,e.g. "Alice: for algorithm,Bob: for coding,etc."
    * Because We  will grade it by their members' contribution,participation in group,also the correctness,programming,etc.
* Some of the early labs they may be able to complete during the lab time. The instructoe would allow a submission to be made upto two weeks after the lab date, but
never after the last day of classes
* If any question you can contact me by email in blackborad.



### Lab 1
