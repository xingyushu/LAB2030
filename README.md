# LAB of computing III
A reference for computing III lab

### Need to know 

* The computing III labs are done by a group of four.You can checkout the members and discuss together.
* One submission by the "presenter" from each group made via blackboard. You can refer the  presenter in code comments,e.g. "Alice: for algorithm,Bob: for coding,etc."
    * Because We  will grade it by their members' contribution,participation in group,also the correctness,programming,etc.
    * You can comment "who do what" in your code.
* Some of the early labs they may be able to complete during the lab time. The instructor would allow a submission to be made upto two weeks after the lab date, but
never after the last day of classes. 
* Once you finish the lab on class,Please tell me your group name and present it clear about your code,result,contribution of members.You can submit for several times until you think it perfect.
* Submit inteface : The homepage or lab details under corresponding lab #number.
* If any question you can contact me by email in blackborad.

### Grading criterion
* Base(finish+present): 95 (All members show up,explain the code and excute as sample,done; *Prof. said,the guy who don't show up would get zero.*)

* Well-Format/structure:+2 (e.g. precision as sample, 98.04 not 98.0395... ; Main Function ——> Sub Function... ; The variable definition consistant, Student_ID,StudentName,Studentaddress,studentCourse,...)

* Good code Comment:+2 (e.g. explain the function or related)

* Comment about contribution:+1 (It is a proof about the group job)

* Good Habits cntribute to long-Term development not just a score.
