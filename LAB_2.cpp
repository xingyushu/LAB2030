// Write a program that asks the user to enter a weight given in pounds and ounces, where you store
// pounds in a variable of type int and ounces in a variable of type double. Convert this weight to
// kilograms and grams, where kilograms is stored in a variable of type int and grams is stored in a
// variable of type double.
  
  
  

//The code 

//Function 1
// void getInput() :The first function should be used to get two input values 


//Function 2
//void transferParameters( pounds, ounces, kilograms, and grams): After it is run,
// this function will have changed the values of kilograms and grams so that they represent an
// equivalent weight to our original input value in pounds and ounces. Here, you will still need to use
// the pass-by-reference mechanism

//Function 3
//output the result of the calculation

//Fnuction main()
//Good comment is needed
